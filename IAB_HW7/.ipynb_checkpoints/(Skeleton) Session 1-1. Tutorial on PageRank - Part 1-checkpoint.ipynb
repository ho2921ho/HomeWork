    "\n",
    "Before finishing this session, let's check the problem of the dense matrix version of PageRank `iterate_PageRank`. \n",
    "The main issue of the dense matrix version is a *scalability*, i.e., when we need to handle a large-scale network, that function requires intractable running time and memory space. \n",
    "More specifically, the function requires $O(n^{2})$ space from the row-normalized adjacency matrix `nA`, an $n \\times n$ matrix where $n$ is the number of nodes. \n",
    "Also, for each iteration, it requires $O(n^{2})$ time due to the dense matrix-vector multiplication `nAT.dot(old_p)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One notable thing is that a (large) real-world network is extremely sparse. \n",
    "From many real-world networks, we can notice that the number $m$ of edges is constantly linear to the number $n$ of nodes, i.e., $m = cn$ where $c$ is a certain constant. \n",
    "If we can ignore storing $0$ values in a matrix (or only store non-zero values), we are able to reduce the time and space complexities to $O(m)$, which is much smaller than $O(n^2)$.  "
